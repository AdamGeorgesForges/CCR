Today started at 8am.I was imeaditately called into the office to do work on a ticket that had come in the email at 7am. 
The email was in regards to a client of Jaime's managed services. They needed to set up another account on someon in the companies old machine. He logged into a Microsoft 365 account that managed all the users in the company I think. Then went to the user in question who's old macchine was to be usedd and copied it to put into Amy (thenew employee's credentials or something. Hegot very frustrated when the machine was not online, ads he could not access it.) Then Sharon came in. SHe was out of breath and instead of having concern, he raised his voice while asking her to leave to a different phone area. I'm not saying that she was'nt the right person for the job, but she may be too old for the role Jaimie expects of her. He's described the role to be "the quarter back of the team. Involved in every play and able to direct customers to the proper places". I think he hired the wrong person for the job, as sweet as she is. It' strange to be in a room where I feel spmone else is mistreated, but at the same time- I'm there to learn what not to do. I caught up with her and asked how everything was going, she seemed out of breath- did she park far away? She did, and then was out of breath making it all the way to the shop. I helperd her to the desk where she didnt know was, but Jaimie had directed her to. While moving her things there for her I caught up on some f the work being done in the shop. There were two machines I had worjked on. One had a psu INSTALLED THAT i DIAGNOSED THROUGH cHATgPT the other was not giving a screen when plugged into an external screen, then unplugged from said external screen. On the one with the PSU i had forrgotten to write down htat it needed RAM, then it was suggested if I had truly found that RAM was one of the issues- instead of testing the RAM on the spot I doubled down on the fact that I had tried both RAM sticks at the minimal testing (motherboard, RAM,power etc) and then looked for more RAM. Eventually, when it seemed like no one wanted to answer me what the protocol was for adding RAM to the necessary parts- afraid to take on responsibility for another delay, I tested the RAM and then asked for help on testing it to whih I was met by at least 3 different answers and an increasingly adversarial push from Dale about wanting to be involved or help me at all. After a number of belittling comments by him I calmly asked what he would do and he ran me through a windos native memory test at the command line. This was Later deemed "a bullshit test" by Jaimie and ordered to be packed upand set for quality control testing. Meanwhile, the other device was one I had'nt put my notes in yet for. It was brought to my attention by Cooper who brought it to Jaimie's attention after being questioned about what was going on with it since the owner had called on saturday. I gave a brief explanationa nd he said to put it on the notes- fair enough, I had yet to type it up so I put a brief summary of what I had done, that is remove the GPU drivers, to no avail and was ready to move into the configuration testing of the two drivers. Once printed, I turn to see that the laptop had moved agian (first moved to the back for some reason) and now was in front of Dale who was ranting about what is going on with the machine, how ccan I know- Im not reading the notes since they are instructions and dont tell me anything about whats been done. I then explain that the notes summarize what I had done, to which he responded that he needed more detail because that could mean anything. Then went into a diatribe about his process and how precise his tools are and that I cant go around doing whatever to computers, do I know if its Bitlocked? Do I have the Bitlock key?- Well isnt that why we have a back up I respond- yeah but what if that backup is bad? - Well I havve the password and login....- yeah but I didnt check your back up, how can I know if its good- fair enough Dale, what would you do then?- I would run an entire suite of tests that you dont even know about, tools that are so precise and efficient they could handle it, god knows what you've done- What tools would that be Dale?- DDU ITS A - Yeah thats what i used, booted into safe mode- ...at which point he grabs the paper off the benh and throws them at me. Not what i would call professional, adult, or even highschool behavior, but nonetheless it reinforces that systems are necessary and my failure to adhere to the system i place- as archaic as it is (paper copies of the current status) - I failed to execute my part of the team. I said, very well Dale, let me type those notes up for us. I proceeded to document every single step I had taken alongside AI in diagnosing the issues. Each step bearing my initials and a time stamp. I did not hear from Dale after that, only mutterings and loud "someone made TWO C:'s AHA! Thats IT!"  then looked at me and asked if I had done an inplace windows update- to which I asked him to reference the notes, and I then asked curiously what an in place windows install was- he didnt offer that information( my guess is he plugged in the backup and they were both labeled...C:...) I continued with fixing the quality check and there were some leftover drivers from an old hard drive or something that kept showing up in Windows Defender as a problem even after COooper had fixed them and rebooted. Jaimie again got involved and asked Dale if he knew anything about it to which he replied, "Yeah a couple hours of trial and error could get rid of that". Jaimie said we needed it in 15 minutes and for Dale to fix it- Dale ordered Cooper to write down each code. I imeaditaley took a picture of it and asked the GPT Im training to turn it into text. Dale said I dont want to be looking at Adams phone when cooper pointed out I had a picture. I turned the text to a PDF and printed it then handed it to Dale. He said, optimally it would be a text file i could copy and paste into and from since I'll need to do a lot of googling and research. I began to pull up an emailbut stopped myself short wondering hy I even bothered relying on Dale at all and got the cmd bash to fix the errors, Dale for some reason or another threw his hands up and fumed off to a different machine and opened Google. I opened cmd and cleared the errors, rebooted and they were gone in a matter of 2 minutes. Cooper asked what I had done and I explained that things like this can easily be delt with through th command line and automated. He was ecstatic and onboard saying thats what hed been wanting to do all along. Jorge jumped on board and said hell yeah throw that shit into ChatGPT. I said, no need to rely on Dale if he doesnt want to be cooperative, out with the old in with the new. Ive been training this model on all the diagnostic data I can. I was then pulled away to go on client out calls and spent the rest of the dya with Jaimie- the owner. He informed me that something had gone wrong with the internet I had set up a week ago. I asked what the protocol was and he said that we do nothing, let the guy be mad and if he asks for a refund we give it to him- I didnt agree but stayed silent. I think we should have called, gone thereand made it right. Regardless I took notes on what he did all day and eill upload those to the daily notes folder. SOme key take aways though: I asked, how much money do you need to be profitable each day, to which he replied- "Well I own the business that owns the building so I can adjust the rent as we need. I was told by someone a while ago that if i didnt own the building I wouldnt be able to be around. Property taxes ar 15k Internet is expensive, and payroll is expensive. It's a constant balance of making sure I have enough people there when it gets busy, and not a lot when its slow." This is a key insight, since it along with the central location makes it seem like it was a right place right time business ran by the wring businessman. Thoguh he seems finacnially savy, as he has multiple corporations by his own words, the ones I know of are: the shop operates independently of the "Phoenix Outcall"(which handles outcalls and managed services) and any repairs done by Phoenix for their "CLients" are ran throughthe shop-Im guessing to set the standard rate of services, and be able to charge more than theshop rate to clients- on top of I hear all the time Phoenix doesnt carry inventory thats all tracked through 4PCHELP(the shop). Im curious as to how this finacial approach makes him more money. then theres the business that owns the building and from what ive put together through small mentions of "offices" (e.g., the alsakan house where Anne Henry, his partner, accountant and receptionist lives/ works from). I saw an invoice for nearly 10 instances of "Backup" charged at over $100 each as a managed service for a client. If those are the backups Im thinking about, it was done remotely or through the cloud, but scheduled and synced - and made him 1000 fucking dollars without lifting a finger since its most likely on autopilot. Huge thing to look into. Furthermore, his clients are poeple hes been in business with for decades, as he runs office buildings that are built on these workhorse machines that run small business with 5-12 employees. thats all for tonight. Ill upload the notes from today and end this dialogue.
